          <p>At my core, I am three things: an artist, a rebel and entrepreneur. Creativity and curiosity drive me to explore, yet for much of my journey I have felt confined by the traditional. I have always been drawn to the unconventional, the abstract, the surreal.</p>
          <p>Though music is my first love. The sound, the why, the how—all of it is part of me. Music keeps evolving, and I refuse to be another musician lost in the sound. I want to question, to innovate, to reimagine the role of music and art in a shifting culture.</p>
